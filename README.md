🌐 Cisco Packet Tracer – Small Office / Home Office (SOHO) Network
📖 Description
This project is a Cisco Packet Tracer simulation of a small office network spread across two buildings. 
The network is designed to be secure, scalable, and efficient, featuring a dedicated server for services and a central router to manage traffic between the two LANs and a simulated internet connection.

🖧 Network Topology
The topology connects:
🖥️ PCs & laptops in two buildings
📶 Wireless Access Points for mobility
🔗 Switches for wired connectivity
🌍 A central router for LAN-to-LAN and internet communication
🗄️ A dedicated server for DHCP & DNS

✨ Features
🏢 LAN Design
Robust two-building network connected via a central router.
Switches and wireless access points provide both wired and wireless access.

🎯 IP Addressing
Server (192.24.24.2) with a static IP.
Router configured as a DHCP Relay Agent to serve both LANs.

🌍 NAT & Internet Access
NAT enabled on the router.
Internal devices share a single public IP to access the internet.

🔤 DNS Service
Internal server also functions as a DNS server.
Provides name resolution for all connected clients.

🔀 Inter-LAN Routing
Router1 configured to allow seamless communication between both LANs.
